# liri-node-app

Liri is a Node application built to work on the Terminal/bash.

To run the application:

In a new Terminal window go to directory which contains liri.js
	
	Type: Node liri.js <command> <argument>

available commands: my-tweets
		    movie-this
		    spotify-this-song
		    do-what-it-says

passing an argument is optional, except my-tweets and do-what-it-says which take no arguments.

If no argument is passed to movie-this and spotify-this-song then the application returns default searches.

Fill in the blank fields in the keys.js file using your own api-keys.
Otherwise the application will not work.
